# AutoTestLoc
Traditional manual testing is known for its sluggish pace and high costs, often resulting in 
incomplete coverage and overlooked bugs. Studies show that manual testing efforts can uncover 
only around 80% of defects. Our project, AutoTestLoc, aims to revolutionize this outdated 
approach by leveraging large language models (LLMs) for automated test case generation and 
code fault localization. By harnessing the potent capabilities of the Llama2 and Llama3 models, 
we seek to significantly enhance the effectiveness of testing endeavors for developers. The project 
addresses the challenges faced in achieving comprehensive test coverage and efficient bug 
detection by automating the test case generation process and precisely pinpointing the location of 
problems in the source code. This dual focus on automated test case generation and code fault 
localization aims to streamline the testing procedure, reduce debugging time and effort, and 
ultimately enhance the reliability and functionality of software systems. The project addresses the

testing process through automated test case generation and improving code fault localization by 
accurately identifying the exact lines and types of errors. AutoTestLoc represents a significant 
advancement in software quality assurance, offering a cost-effective and dependable solution for 
improving software reliability and customer satisfaction. Through innovative testing 
methodologies and the integration of LLM technology, we aim to set new standards in software 
testing practices and contribute to the ongoing evolution of software development processes.
